Important Maq Info/Summary
MAQ is a program that will assemble sequence reads into scaffolds and contigs when given a reference to use for comparison.  There are a number of different functions that MAQ uses to put its data in the proper form and assemble the reads.  These steps are not automated and must be completed in the correct order by the user each time.  Here is a list of the most useful functions/the functions I have used so far:
maq fasta2bfa
maq fastq2bfq
maq map
maq mapmerge
maq mapcheck
maq assemble
maq cns2fq
maq cns2snp
maq pileup
maq mapview
maqindex 
maqview

MAQ does not like its sequences to include characters other than A, T, C, G, N.  Which means, no Xs.

To receive help in the terminal window, type <maq>.
