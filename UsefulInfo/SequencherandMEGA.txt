Sequencher/Mega Info and Summary
Sequencher and MEGA are alignment and analysis tools that take a gene sequence (or sequences) as input and can align and analyze them.  Duh…  Things to remember about both:

Sequencher
•	Click on an assembled Contig[…] to bring up the Overview screen.  From here, click on the bottom aligned portion and use <Command N> then <spacebar> to cycle through SNPS
•	Contigs can be dissolved and have nodes removed from them.
•	When deleting excess bases in the beginning of a sequence, use <shift-[> to highlight the desired portion then <delete> to remove it.  When deleting excess bases from the end of a sequence use <shift-]> to highlight the desired portion then <backspace> to remove it.
•	To combine contigs into one sequence:  trim so there is no overlap, export them as a consensus.
MEGA
•	The Distances menu contains a way to compute syn-nonsynonymous rate variation
•	Codon based Z-test is in the Selection menu
