Important Velvet Info/Summary
Velvet is a program that performs de novo assembly of sequence reads.  This means that it is capable of assemble short reads without the use of a reference genome.  Here are the primary velvet functions:
./velveth
./velvetg

./velveth must be run before ./velvetg.  Be sure to use ./ for giving your command in the terminal window!
For help running either of these two functions, type the function into the command line and hit enter without entering any parameters.
